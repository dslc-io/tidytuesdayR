{tidytuesdayR} has the main goal to make it easy to participate in the weekly [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project. 
Currently this is done by assisting with the import of data posted on the [R4DataScience](https://github.com/rfordatascience) Tidy Tuesday repository.

## Installation

Currently this package is only available on GitHub:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#install.package("devtools")
devtools::install_github("thebioengineer/tidytuesdayR")
```

## Usage

There are currently two methods to access the data from the respository. 

### tt_load()
The first and simplest way is to use the 'tt_load()' function.
This function has accepts two types of inputs to determine which data to grab.
It can be a date as a string in the YYYY-MM-DD format like below.

```{r}
library(tidytuesdayR)
tt_data <- tt_load("2019-01-15")
```

Or the function can accept the year as the first argument, and which week of the year as the second.

```{r}
tt_data <- tt_load(2019, week=3) 
```

`tt_load()` naively downloads *all* the data that is available and stores them in the resulting `tt_data` object.
To access the data, use the `$` or `[[` notation and the name of the dataset.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tt_data$agencies
tt_data[["agencies"]]
```

### tt_load_gh() and tt_read_data()
The second method to access the data from the repository is to use the combination of `tt_load_gh()` and `tt_read_data()` functions.
`tt_load_gh()` takes similar arguments as `tt_load()`, in that either the date or a combination of year and week can be entered.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tt <- tt_load_gh("2019-01-15")
```
 
The `tt` object lists the available files for download.
To download the data, use the `tt_read_data()` function.
`tt_read_data()` expects the first argument to be the `tt` object.
The second argument can be a string indicating the name of the file to download from the repository, or the index in the `tt` object 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
agencies <- tt %>% 
  tt_read_data("agencies.csv")

# The first index of the tt object is `agencies.csv`
# agencies <- tt %>% 
#   tt_read_data(1)
```
 
## Tidy Tuesday Details

The tt_data and tt objects both have a function for showing the readme for that week called `readme()`.
In addition, the print methods for both objects show the readme in a viewer and the available datasets in the console.

```r
readme(tt_data)
print(tt_data)
```

    ## Available Datasets:
    ##  agencies 
    ##  launches 
    ##
