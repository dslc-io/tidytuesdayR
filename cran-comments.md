## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* I have wrapped all non-essential functions in a "\donttest" instead of "\dontrun"

* Functions will now return a message if there is no internet connectivity or no more API calls available rather than erroring with an informative message

## Test environments
* local R installation, R 4.0.0
* ubuntu 16.04 (on github actions), R 4.0.0
* mac OS 10.15.4 (on github actions) R-devel, R 4.0.0,
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

## Downstream dependencies

There are currently no downstream dependencies on this package as it is the first CRAN submission
